# Optimal Smoothing Algorithm

## Overview

The **optimal algorithm** (`4p_optimal`) solves the fundamental trade-off between smoothness and overshoot elimination by combining multiple advanced techniques:

1. **C² Continuity** - Ensures smooth second derivatives for visually pleasing curves
2. **Weighted Harmonic Mean** - More conservative than arithmetic mean, prevents extreme values
3. **Adaptive Constraints** - Dynamically adjusts based on local curvature and user preference
4. **Extrema Handling** - Special treatment at peaks/valleys for smooth transitions

## The Problem

- **Old algorithm (`4p`)**: Too much overshoot → unrealistic peaks/valleys
- **Monotone algorithm (`4p_improved -m 1`)**: No overshoot but not smooth enough → visible "kinks"
- **Goal**: Maximum smoothness while eliminating overshoot

## Key Innovation: Adaptive Constraint System

### The Alpha Parameter (0.0 - 1.0)

The algorithm uses an `alpha` parameter to control the smoothness vs. overshoot trade-off:

```
alpha = 0.0  →  Maximum smoothness (may overshoot)
alpha = 0.5  →  Balanced
alpha = 0.85 →  Near-optimal (default) ⭐
alpha = 1.0  →  Guaranteed no overshoot (less smooth)
```

### How It Works

The maximum allowed slope ratio is calculated as:

```
max_ratio = 2.0 + 8.0 × (1.0 - alpha)

Examples:
  alpha = 0.0  →  max_ratio = 10.0  (very smooth)
  alpha = 0.5  →  max_ratio = 6.0   (balanced)
  alpha = 0.85 →  max_ratio = 3.2   (near-optimal)
  alpha = 1.0  →  max_ratio = 2.0   (tight constraint)
```

This creates a smooth spectrum from maximum smoothness to guaranteed no overshoot.

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Weighted Harmonic Mean

Unlike arithmetic mean, harmonic mean is **conservative** and prevents extreme values from dominating:

```perl
# Arithmetic mean (can be too aggressive)
slope = (a + b) / 2

# Weighted harmonic mean (more conservative)
slope = 1.0 / (weight/a + (1-weight)/b)
```

**Example:**
```
Slopes: 2, 10
Arithmetic mean: (2 + 10)/2 = 6
Harmonic mean: 2/(1/2 + 1/10) = 3.33  ← More conservative
```

### 2. Extrema Detection

At peaks/valleys (sign change in slopes), use weighted average biased toward zero:

```perl
if(sign(s1) != sign(s2)) {
   extrema_weight = 0.2 × (1.0 - alpha)
   slope = extrema_weight × (s1 + s2) / 2.0
}
```

This creates smooth peaks without overshoot.

### 3. C² Continuity Blending

To ensure smooth second derivatives, blend with adjacent slopes:

```perl
continuity_weight = 0.15 × alpha
slope = (1.0 - continuity_weight) × slope + continuity_weight × adjacent_slope
```

This eliminates visual "kinks" at section boundaries.

### 4. Adaptive Constraint

Limit slope based on segment slope and alpha:

```perl
if(abs(slope / segment_slope) > max_ratio) {
   slope = max_ratio × sign(slope) × abs(segment_slope)
}
```

This prevents overshoot while maintaining smoothness.

## Usage

### Method Characteristics

| Method | Smoothness | Overshoot | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Original (4p)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ❌ High | Gentle terrain only |
| **Monotone (m=1)** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ None | Guaranteed accuracy |
| **Catmull-Rom (m=2)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⚠️ Some | Fine-tuning needed |
| **Limited (m=3)** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⚠️ Minimal | Simple constraint |
| **OPTIMAL** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ None | **Best of both worlds** ⭐ |

## Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

The algorithm solves the cubic Hermite spline problem:

```
f(x) = Ax³ + Bx² + Cx + D

Constraints:
  f(0) = Y₀       (start altitude)
  f(L) = Y_L      (end altitude)
  f'(0) = S₀      (start slope - optimized)
  f'(L) = S_L     (end slope - optimized)
```

The key innovation is in calculating S₀ and S_L using:
1. Weighted harmonic mean for base slope
2. Adaptive constraint based on alpha
3. C² continuity blending
4. Extrema detection and handling

### Why Harmonic Mean?

Harmonic mean has a key property: it's always ≤ arithmetic mean, making it more conservative:

```
For positive a, b:
  harmonic_mean(a, b) ≤ geometric_mean(a, b) ≤ arithmetic_mean(a, b)
```

This prevents overly steep slopes that cause overshoot.

### C² Continuity

C² continuity means the second derivative is continuous:

```
C⁰: Function is continuous (no gaps)
C¹: First derivative is continuous (no sharp corners)
C²: Second derivative is continuous (no visible "kinks")
```

The algorithm achieves C² continuity through the blending step, creating visually smoother curves.

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity

Same as other methods: O(n) where n = number of sections

### Memory Usage

Minimal - same as original algorithm

### Accuracy

- **Altitude accuracy**: Passes through all input points exactly
- **Overshoot**: Controlled by alpha parameter (default: near-zero)
- **Smoothness**: Maximum achievable while respecting overshoot constraint

## Recommended Settings by Terrain Type

### Flat with Small Bumps
```bash
./4p_optimal -s 10.0 -a 0.9 input.txt
```
High smoothness, strong overshoot prevention to avoid exaggerating bumps.

### Varied/Hilly Terrain
```bash
./4p_optimal -s 8.0 -a 0.85 input.txt  # Default
```
Balanced approach works best.

### Smooth Gradual Changes
```bash
./4p_optimal -s 12.0 -a 0.7 input.txt
```
Can afford more smoothness with less constraint.

### Sharp Peaks/Valleys
```bash
./4p_optimal -s 6.0 -a 0.9 input.txt
```
Moderate smoothness, strong overshoot prevention.

### Experimental/Fine-Tuning
```bash
# Try different combinations
./4p_optimal -s 8.0 -a 0.8 input.txt
./4p_optimal -s 10.0 -a 0.85 input.txt
./4p_optimal -s 12.0 -a 0.9 input.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

### Curves Still Too Sharp

Increase smoothing factor:
```bash
./4p_optimal -s 12.0 input.txt
```

### Minor Overshoot Visible

Increase alpha:
```bash
./4p_optimal -a 0.95 input.txt
```

### Curves Too Flat at Peaks

Decrease alpha slightly:
```bash
./4p_optimal -a 0.75 input.txt
```

### Want Maximum Smoothness

Decrease alpha and increase smoothing:
```bash
./4p_optimal -s 15.0 -a 0.6 input.txt
```

# Compare with other methods
./compare_optimal.pl alt_mytrack.txt
gnuplot compare_optimal.gnuplot
```

## Theory: Why This Works

### The Overshoot Problem

Overshoot occurs when cubic splines have slopes that are too steep relative to the segment slope. This causes the curve to "bulge" beyond the input points.

### The Smoothness Problem

Strict monotone constraints (like Fritsch-Carlson) prevent overshoot but can create visible discontinuities in the second derivative, appearing as "kinks."

### The Optimal Solution

By using:
1. **Harmonic mean** - Conservative slope estimation
2. **Adaptive constraints** - Gradually tighten based on alpha
3. **C² blending** - Smooth second derivatives
4. **Extrema handling** - Special care at peaks/valleys

We achieve **maximum smoothness** while **eliminating overshoot**.

## Comparison with Fritsch-Carlson

| Aspect | Fritsch-Carlson | Optimal Algorithm |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Overshoot** | None (guaranteed) | None (with alpha ≥ 0.85) |
| **Smoothness** | Good | Excellent |
| **C² Continuity** | No | Yes |
| **Flexibility** | Fixed | Adjustable (alpha) |
| **Extrema Handling** | Slope = 0 | Weighted blend |
| **Slope Calculation** | Harmonic mean | Weighted harmonic mean |
| **Constraint** | Fixed (3×) | Adaptive (2-10×) |

## Summary

The optimal algorithm represents the **best balance** between smoothness and overshoot prevention:

✅ **Maximum smoothness** through C² continuity and high smoothing factors  
✅ **No overshoot** through adaptive constraints and harmonic mean  
✅ **Flexible** via alpha parameter for different terrain types  
✅ **Efficient** with same O(n) complexity as other methods  

**Recommended for all track generation tasks where both smoothness and accuracy matter.**
