# 4p Improvements Summary - Overshoot Minimization

## What Was Changed

### Original Problem
The original `4p` program uses cubic splines with a simple slope blending method that can produce **overshoot** - where the altitude curve exceeds the input altitude values, creating unrealistic bumps and dips.

### Solution Implemented
Created `4p_improved` with **4 different smoothing methods** to minimize or eliminate overshoot while maintaining smooth transitions.

## Available Methods

### Method 1: Monotone (Fritsch-Carlson) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Command:** `./4p_improved -m 1 <input>`

**Key Innovation:**
- Implements Fritsch-Carlson monotone cubic interpolation
- **Guarantees no overshoot** between altitude points
- Uses harmonic mean for slope calculation
- Applies constraints: slope magnitude ≤ 3× segment slope
- Sets slope to 0 at local extrema (peaks/valleys)

**Algorithm:**
```perl
# Detect sign changes (prevents false peaks/valleys)
if(sign(slope_left) != sign(slope_mid)) {
   slope = 0;  # Flat at extrema
}

# Harmonic mean (prevents extreme slopes)
slope = (w1 + w2) / (w1/slope_left + w2/slope_mid);

# Fritsch-Carlson constraint (limits curvature)
if(abs(slope / slope_mid) > 3.0) {
   slope = 3.0 * sign(slope) * abs(slope_mid);
}
```

**Best For:** All terrain types, especially varied/hilly profiles

---

### Method 2: Catmull-Rom with Tension
**Command:** `./4p_improved -m 2 -t <tension> <input>`

**Key Innovation:**
- Adds tension parameter (0.0 to 1.0) to control smoothness
- tension = 0.0: Standard Catmull-Rom (smooth, may overshoot)
- tension = 0.5: Balanced
- tension = 1.0: Maximum tension (linear, no overshoot)

**Algorithm:**
```perl
slope = (1.0 - tension) * (y_next - y_prev) / (x_next - x_prev);
```

**Best For:** Fine-tuning smoothness vs. overshoot tradeoff

---

### Method 3: Limited Slopes (Clamped)
**Command:** `./4p_improved -m 3 <input>`

**Key Innovation:**
- Averages adjacent slopes then clamps to their range
- Simple constraint-based approach

**Algorithm:**
```perl
slope = (slope_left + slope_mid) / 2.0;

# Clamp to range
min_slope = min(slope_left, slope_mid);
max_slope = max(slope_left, slope_mid);
slope = clamp(slope, min_slope, max_slope);
```

**Best For:** Fast, simple reduction of overshoot

---

### Method 0: Original (Baseline)
**Command:** `./4p <input>` or `./4p_improved -m 0 <input>`

**Original Algorithm:**
```perl
# Blend slopes based on magnitude
if(abs(slope_mid) < abs(slope_right)) {
   SL = slope_mid + (slope_right + slope_mid) / smooth;
} else {
   SL = slope_right + (slope_right + slope_mid) / smooth;
}
```

**Best For:** Smooth, gradual terrain where overshoot is acceptable

---

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Slope Calculation
**Before:** Simple blending based on magnitude
```perl
SL = slope_mid + (slope_right + slope_mid) / smooth;
```

**After (Monotone):** Harmonic mean with constraints
```perl
# Harmonic mean (prevents extremes)
slope = (w1 + w2) / (w1/slope_left + w2/slope_mid);

# Constraint (prevents overshoot)
if(abs(slope / slope_mid) > 3.0) {
   slope = 3.0 * sign(slope) * abs(slope_mid);
}
```

### 2. Monotonicity Preservation
**Before:** No check for monotonicity
**After:** Detects and handles local extrema
```perl
if(sign(slope_left) != sign(slope_mid)) {
   slope = 0;  # Flat at peaks/valleys
}
```

### 3. Overshoot Prevention
**Before:** No explicit overshoot prevention
**After:** Multiple strategies:
- Monotone: Mathematical guarantee via Fritsch-Carlson
- Catmull-Rom: Tension parameter reduces curvature
- Limited: Hard clamping to adjacent slope range

## Mathematical Background

### Cubic Hermite Spline
All methods use the same cubic polynomial form:
```
f(x) = Ax³ + Bx² + Cx + D
f'(x) = 3Ax² + 2Bx + C
```

Given:
- L = section length
- Y₀, Y_L = start/end altitudes
- S₀, S_L = start/end slopes

Coefficients:
```
A = [L(S₀ + S_L) + 2(Y₀ - Y_L)] / L³
B = [L(-2S₀ - S_L) - 3(Y₀ - Y_L)] / L²
C = S₀
D = Y₀
```

### The Key Difference: Slope Calculation
The methods differ **only** in how they calculate S₀ and S_L. The cubic polynomial formulation remains the same.

**Original:** Magnitude-based blending
**Monotone:** Harmonic mean + Fritsch-Carlson constraints
**Catmull-Rom:** Tension-adjusted central difference
**Limited:** Average + clamping

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start with monotone method:**
   ```bash
   ./4p_improved -m 1 alt_mytrack.txt
   ```

2. **Compare visually:**
   ```bash
   ./compare_methods.pl alt_mytrack.txt
   gnuplot compare_all.gnuplot
   ```

3. **Fine-tune if needed:**
   - Too flat? Try Catmull-Rom with low tension
   - Still overshooting? Verify using monotone method
   - Need maximum smoothness? Use original with high smoothing factor

4. **Validate in GPL:**
   - Import `__gtk_csv.TXT` into track editor
   - Drive the track
   - Check for unrealistic bumps/dips
