Create GPL track editing altitude trace equation coefficients. Each equation is defned by 4 point sets. 

Import altitude data one column for each trace.

Input Format:

   Section Length, Track X, Trace 1 Altitude, Trace 2 Altitude, ...

Crates stitched gnuplot formulas for each trace and section of the track for visualizing equation curves.
