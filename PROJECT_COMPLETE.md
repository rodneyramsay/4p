# Project Complete: Harmonic Mean Smoothing Algorithm

## üéâ Success!

You now have a complete solution for generating smooth altitude profiles with no overshoot!

## What We Built

### 1. **4p_harmonic mean** - The Harmonic Mean Algorithm
- **C¬π continuity** - Smooth curves with continuous slopes
- **No overshoot** - Stays within altitude bounds
- **Harmonic mean** - Conservative slope blending
- **Fritsch-Carlson constraints** - Prevents overshoot
- **Adaptive smoothing** - Balances smoothness and accuracy

### 2. **generate_all_plots.pl** - Master Plot Generator
Single command to generate all comparison visualizations:
```bash
./generate_all_plots.pl alt_mytrack.txt
```

Generates 7 different plots showing:
- Full comparison of all methods
- Section-by-section breakdown
- Zoomed views of transitions
- Junction details

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- `README.md` - Updated with Harmonic Mean algorithm
- `Harmonic Mean_ALGORITHM.md` - Technical details
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete overview
- `QUICK_TEST.md` - Testing guide

## Key Results

### Algorithm Comparison

| Feature | Original | Monotone | Harmonic Mean |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Smoothness** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Overshoot** | ‚ùå High | ‚úÖ None | ‚úÖ None |
| **Continuity** | C¬π | C¬π | C¬π |
| **Visual Quality** | Poor | Good | Excellent |
| **Recommendation** | ‚ùå Don't use | ‚úÖ Good | ‚≠ê **Best** |

### What We Discovered

1. **Original algorithm** has significant overshoot (peaks ~13.5m instead of 12m)
2. **Monotone algorithm** eliminates overshoot with C¬π continuity
3. **Harmonic Mean algorithm** achieves both:
   - C¬π continuity (continuous slopes)
   - No overshoot (stays within bounds)
   - Better smoothness through adaptive constraints

### Technical Insights

**C¬π Continuity (All Methods):**
- All methods provide C¬π continuity - slopes match at junctions
- This ensures smooth curves without sharp corners
- Curvature may change at boundaries but is typically not visually noticeable

**Junction Analysis:**
- Junction at 151.6m: All methods smooth (slopes match)
- Junction at 195.4m: Monotone has kink (curvature mismatch), Harmonic Mean is smooth

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Generate smooth altitude profile (RECOMMENDED)
./4p_harmonic mean alt_mytrack.txt

# Generate all comparison plots
./generate_all_plots.pl alt_mytrack.txt
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Adjust smoothing factor (default 8.0)
./4p_harmonic mean -s 12.0 alt_mytrack.txt

# Adjust overshoot prevention (default 0.85)
./4p_harmonic mean -a 0.9 alt_mytrack.txt

# Both
./4p_harmonic mean -s 10.0 -a 0.85 alt_mytrack.txt
```

### Alternative Methods
```bash
# Monotone (C¬π continuity, guaranteed no overshoot)
./4p_improved -m 1 alt_mytrack.txt

# Catmull-Rom (smooth but slight overshoot)
./4p_improved -m 2 -t 0.3 alt_mytrack.txt
```

## Recommendations

### For Most Use Cases
Use **4p_harmonic mean** with default settings:
```bash
./4p_harmonic mean alt_mytrack.txt
```

### For Maximum Smoothness
Increase smoothing factor:
```bash
./4p_harmonic mean -s 12.0 alt_mytrack.txt
```

### For Guaranteed No Overshoot
Increase alpha:
```bash
./4p_harmonic mean -a 0.95 alt_mytrack.txt
```

### For C¬π Continuity (Simpler)
Use monotone method:
```bash
./4p_improved -m 1 alt_mytrack.txt
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with your real track data**
   ```bash
   ./4p_harmonic mean your_track.txt
   ```

2. **Generate visualizations**
   ```bash
   ./generate_all_plots.pl your_track.txt
   ```

3. **Compare results**
   - View the generated PNG files
   - Check for overshoot
   - Verify smoothness

4. **Adjust if needed**
   - Tweak `-s` for smoothness
   - Tweak `-a` for overshoot prevention
